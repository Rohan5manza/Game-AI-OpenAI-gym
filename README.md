RL agents 

I first studied, then created, different RL agents using basic implementation of RL in OpenAI gym.

While I was studying this domain, I tried out various different scenarios in RL using OpenAI gym, such as Atari games, simulations of mountain car, cartpole balancing , etc. Mostly I used Google colab( which is tedious when it comes to rendering animations or videos or even simple matplotlib graphs), but also ran Stable Baselines3 on local machine.
Stable Baselines3 is for RL algorithms, like Scikit-learn is for ML algorithms.

Synopsis: 
Demis Hassabis, founder of Deepmind, the company that made AlphaGo and AlphaZero, says that video games are the best way to train AI agents using reinforcement learning, for many reasons, mostly because games are the perfect way to run any number of simulations, trails and errors, in order to improve the AI agent.

This repository contains main projects I have done, plus other programs I first tried by referring from other sources, as well as my notes and important insights.

The main projects I did, include :
1. Cartpole, in google colab
2. Mountain car, first in google colab, then on local machine in python, using Stable Baselines3


Future plans: 
1.try out MineRL (malmo), for RL in Minecraft.
2. Try rendering animations next time. This time I had to suffice with only tracking changes in values of the reward mechanism
3. Try out different RL algorithms on a single simulation, track differences in performance
4.try out unique combinations, like: penalize an agent to avoid taking wide strides or deviations, change the policy, set some extra constraints, to see how the behaviour changes.
