Demis Hassabis, founder of Deepmind, the company that made AlphaGo and AlphaZero, says that video games are the best way to train AI agents using reinforcement learning, for many reasons, mostly because games are the perfect way to run any number of simulations, trails and errors, in order to improve the AI agent.
